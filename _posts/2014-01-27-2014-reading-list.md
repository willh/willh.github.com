In the spirit of openness and in order to trick myself into actually doing the things I intend by committing publically, I'm making a reading list to track the books that I want to read this year. Each time I think of a new book I'll tack it on to the end of the list (or higher up if I want to prioritise it) and each time I finish one I'll mark it off and try to post a short summary review here.
