Hello there. It's probably about time I created a public blog (I'm not counting the one I had somewhere on a free geocities-style host back in 2002). This will hopefully be a place for me to dump thoughts and notes about things, most likely to be related to software development. 

At the moment, the blog is just a static site hosted on Github Pages, hastily cobbled together with an interesting tool called [Jekyll-Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com) which quickly and easily generates a skeleton site for preprocessing with Jekyll.
