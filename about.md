I'm a Technical Architect at [Kainos](http://www.kainos.com) working primarily in systems integration and custom development [(we're hiring)](http://www.kainos.com/careers).

Currently I am based in our Belfast office in Northern Ireland, helping to create better digital services for government and citizens.

Most of my experience is in Java and Scala web applications and web services, with some JavaScript where necessary to make all the shiny whizzbangs. I'm interested in simple, low-ceremony technologies and as a result have been really enjoying the Play! 2.0 framework and DropWizard recently.

Boring disclaimer: You'd be mad to think that the views expressed here necessarily reflect the views of my employer, or our customers/clients/partners. That's crazy.
