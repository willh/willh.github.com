I'm a developer working at [Kainos](http://www.kainos.com) primarily in systems integration and custom development. Most of my experience is in Scala and .Net web applications, with some Java (where I can't get away with using Scala) and JavaScript where necessary to make all the shiny whizzbangs. I'm interested in simple, low-ceremony technologies and as a result have been really enjoying the Play! 2.0 framework and MongoDB recently.

Currently I am working on site in London but I'm originally from Belfast in Northern Ireland, which explains the suspicious accent.

Boring disclaimer: You'd be mad to think that the views expressed in my blog necessarily reflect the views of my employer, our customers/clients/partners. That's crazy.
